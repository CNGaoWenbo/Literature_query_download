# Literature_query_download
Search papers I want and query the content.
Search lieratures and get their metadate by crossref API, then pass the url in metadata to scrawler in order to query content in html.
cross API can be found in github
crawler is based on seleniumn, beautiflsoup.
It is Not Finished. Still working on this
