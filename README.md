# Literature_query_download (around 2019/09)
Search papers by key words and query the content, data and other information.
Search lieratures and get their metadate by Crossref API, then pass the url in metadata to scrawler in order to query content in html.
Crossref API can be found in github
crawler is based on seleniumn, beautiflsoup.
It is Not Finished. Still working on this

Update 2019/11/27
Now can query all articles in Wiley publication.
Imitate download html using seleniumn and chrome drive, so the speed is quite slow. But it is safe.
ChemDataExtractor API seem avaliable, so I may use this to replace beautifulsoup.
